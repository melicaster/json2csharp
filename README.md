# json2csharp
I using this json2csharp.com for a long long time. Suddenly, it was down. After search for a few days, I noticed this author published the source code at GitHub. After I cloned the code, I could run it at my computer. But sometime, I am working at other computer, so I manage to host it at https://json2csharp.melicaster.com/.

# Updated .NET Core, Bootstrap, jQuery
I also took the chance to migrate some of the codes to single library so easier study for those want to know what is going on. I updated the source code to use latest supported .NET Core 3.1, Bootstrap 4.1.1 and jQuery 3.5.0.
